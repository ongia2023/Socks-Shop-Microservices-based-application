Certainly! Here's an expanded version of the documentation including the commands used:

### Introduction

The Sock Shop is a microservices-based sample application used for demonstrating modern software architectures, particularly microservices, containerization, and orchestration.

### Architecture

The architecture of the Sock Shop application consists of several microservices communicating with each other. Each microservice is responsible for a specific domain or functionality.

**Components**:
- **Frontend**: Provides the user interface for browsing and purchasing socks.
- **Microservices**: 
  - Product Catalog
  - Cart
  - Payment
  - Shipping
  - Order
  - User
  - Catalogue
  - Stock
  - Queue-master
- **Database**: MongoDB is used as the primary database for storing product and user information.
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ is used for communication between microservices.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Prometheus for monitoring and ELK stack for logging.

### Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Go, Python, Java, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, Flask, Express
- **Databases**: MongoDB, Redis
- **Containerization and Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Messaging Systems**: RabbitMQ
- **Monitoring and Logging Tools**: Prometheus, ELK stack

### Setup and Installation

#### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Helm

#### Deployment Steps
1. Clone the Sock Shop repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd microservices-demo
   ```

3. Deploy Sock Shop using Kubernetes:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/complete-demo.yaml
   ```

### Usage

Access the Sock Shop frontend UI by navigating to `http://localhost` in your web browser.

### Configuration

- Environment variables are used for configuring individual microservices.
- Configuration files are available in the `deploy/kubernetes` directory.

### Development

- Contributions to the Sock Shop codebase follow standard development practices:
  - Fork the repository and create feature branches for changes.
  - Write unit tests and adhere to coding standards.
  - Submit pull requests for review and integration.

### Deployment

#### Manual Deployment
1. Apply Kubernetes manifests:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/complete-demo.yaml
   ```

#### Automated Deployment
Use CI/CD pipelines with tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI for automated deployments.

### Monitoring and Logging

- Monitor metrics with Prometheus and visualize with Grafana.
- Aggregate logs with the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

### Maintenance and Support

- Regularly update dependencies and patches.
- Refer to troubleshooting guides and community forums for support.
